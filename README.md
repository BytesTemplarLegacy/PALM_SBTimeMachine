This is a **very** old project.  

Once upon a time I used to play around with Palm Pilot development.

This is a rough port of the Strong Bad Time Machine, which was a talking clock that was on HomestarRunner.com.

I make no claims to quality here. I don't even know what state it was left in -- complete?  Incomplete?  No idea.

There's a couple built binaries, though, if you're brave.  (I'm not.)

Enjoy!

EDIT: By the way, the code (as little as there is) is free, but I can't claim any rights to the audio portion. That's straight up Chaps.
